In addition, during their second year, fellows will regularly meet with experienced mentors whose careers and expertise will help guide their potential future work in the public sector, as well as develop a capstone project proposing public policies (executive orders, legislation, regulatory proposals, or state programs) related to key science and technology policy issues.Entering its third year, this initiative will select six science, technology, or engineering doctorate holders as fellows to work closely with senior policymakers in the offices of the governor, the legislature, and state agencies for a two-year period. The fellowship is located in Albany, New York, and will pay selected fellows $85,000 annually\r\n\r\nApplications are open now and due by January 9, 2026 at 11:59PM EST.\r\n\r\nRead More [https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__systemrf.interviewexchange.com_jobofferdetails.jsp-3Bjsessionid-3DA887E63E9CFFDDDAD71BE56B7B2C0E23-3FJOBID-3D194336&d=DwIFaQ&c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&r=W4d5O1KeqHtZtS8Ifj-gIg&m=cwZVnoBfsuYfrvyLBozVGGnwvcCQusxXcZ8EpbS9y6kRZ513CeiAtUIr-4wzEk9Q&s=MYWvaOrFgbcicPSO6oXSp9_yur64M8XXWwsWand7zWk&e= ]                         New Career Resource: Interstride\r\n\r\nOGS and the Wasserman Center have teamed up to bring the NYU community a great new resource for international students as well as students looking to work abroad.

Over the course of the spring semester, students work with mentors (past Threesis alumni, Bobst Subject Librarians, faculty, and more) to distill their graduate research into a 3 minute oral presentation, developed for a casual non-specialized audience. Students that complete all requirements and make it to the Final Round of the Threesis Academic Challenge have the opportunity to win <strong>cash prizes up to $2,000+</strong>.</p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 0;\">Threesis is a unique opportunity to showcase your scholarly research as a master's student in GSAS. Previous participants, finalists, and winners have gone on to pursue PhD programs \r\nand job interviews with success. Threesis develops robust presentation, public speaking, and research skills that are applicable and valuable to further academic research and professional endeavors alike.</p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 0;\">GSAS awards the following prizes:</p><ul style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 24px;padding: 0;list-style-type: disc;\"><li style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 0;\">1st Place: $2,000</li><li style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 0;\">2nd Place: $1,500</li><li style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 0;\">3rd Place: $1000</li><li style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 0;\">4th-6th Place: $400</li><li style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;Margin-left: 0;\">Audience Choice: $750 (in addition to the other prize amount)</li></ul><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 20px;\">Read \r\nmore, see testimonials from former student competitors, and apply below! <strong>Applications are due February 16</strong>.

This includes a week-long orientation and regular coursework featuring guest speakers from various state policy backgrounds and readings on the intersection of science and policy. In addition, during their second year, fellows will regularly meet with experienced mentors whose careers and expertise will help guide their \r\npotential future work in the public sector, as well as develop a capstone project proposing public policies (executive orders, legislation, regulatory proposals, or state programs) related to key science and technology policy issues.Entering its third year, this initiative will select six science, technology, or engineering doctorate holders as fellows to work closely with senior policymakers in the offices of the governor, the legislature, and state agencies for a two-year period. The fellowship is located in Albany, New York, and will pay selected fellows $85,000 annually</p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 20px;\"><strong>Applications are open now and due by&nbsp;January 9, 2026 at 11:59PM EST.</strong></p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div class=\"btn btn--ghost btn--large\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n        <!--[if !mso]><!--><a style=\"border-radius: 0;display: inline-block;font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;padding: 12px 24px;text-align: center;text-decoration: none !important;transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;color: #57068c !important;border: 1px solid #460273;font-family: PT Sans, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;border-color: #57068c;\" href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyugsasstudentaffairs.cmail20.com_t_d-2Dl-2Dgttzg-2Dhlwthulju-2Djt_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&amp;r=W4d5O1KeqHtZtS8Ifj-gIg&amp;m=cwZVnoBfsuYfrvyLBozVGGnwvcCQusxXcZ8EpbS9y6kRZ513CeiAtUIr-4wzEk9Q&amp;s=waIfu0DUJFo9PPXO1MfxLXJqos7EasAvVfoyvB4F7yc&amp;e=\">Read More</a><!--<![endif]-->\r\n      <!--[if mso]><p style=\"line-height:0;margin:0;\">&nbsp;</p><v:rect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyugsasstudentaffairs.cmail20.com_t_d-2Dl-2Dgttzg-2Dhlwthulju-2Djt_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&amp;r=W4d5O1KeqHtZtS8Ifj-gIg&amp;m=cwZVnoBfsuYfrvyLBozVGGnwvcCQusxXcZ8EpbS9y6kRZ513CeiAtUIr-4wzEk9Q&amp;s=waIfu0DUJFo9PPXO1MfxLXJqos7EasAvVfoyvB4F7yc&amp;e=\" style=\"width:84pt\" filled=\"f\" strokecolor=\"#460273\" strokeweight=\"1px\"><v:textbox style=\"mso-fit-shape-to-text:t\" inset=\"0pt,9pt,0pt,9pt\"><center style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:24px;color:#57068C;font-family:PT Sans,Trebuchet MS,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-text-raise:1.5px\">Read More</center></v:textbox></v:rect><![endif]--></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n          </div>\r\n        <!--[if mso]></td></tr></table><![endif]-->\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  \r\n      <div class=\"layout one-col fixed-width stack\" style=\"Margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;min-width: 320px;
