This workshop is designed to help you transform a dissertation chapter into a publishable manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal. We will discuss how to develop transferable writing practices and skills for publication and anticipate reviewers&#8217; assessment. Students attending the workshop should have a draft dissertation chapter, one published journal article from a writer in their field that they admire, and a targeted publication. Students will leave the workshop with a cogent plan for journal publication.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div class=\"btn btn--ghost btn--large\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n        <!--[if !mso]><!--><a style=\"border-radius: 0;display: inline-block;font-size: 14px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;padding: 12px 24px;text-align: center;text-decoration: none !important;transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in;color: #57068c !important;border: 1px solid #460273;font-family: PT Sans, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;border-color: #57068c;\" href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyugsasstudentaffairs.cmail19.com_t_d-2Dl-2Dgjkiduk-2Dhlwthulju-2Dh_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&amp;r=W4d5O1KeqHtZtS8Ifj-gIg&amp;m=rWW33zGngN1JKHDedNM5kZTZpSQv4hMBae2h1BYbtlhkNxL9ntNgmzdZcLzR7-hL&amp;s=gFLwppFSDjU_-1lDT3VY0rq2HodCvB2ldcN2SH3d-ic&amp;e=\">Register</a><!--<![endif]-->\r\n      <!--[if mso]><p style=\"line-height:0;margin:0;\">&nbsp;</p><v:rect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyugsasstudentaffairs.cmail19.com_t_d-2Dl-2Dgjkiduk-2Dhlwthulju-2Dh_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=slrrB7dE8n7gBJbeO0g-IQ&amp;r=W4d5O1KeqHtZtS8Ifj-gIg&amp;m=rWW33zGngN1JKHDedNM5kZTZpSQv4hMBae2h1BYbtlhkNxL9ntNgmzdZcLzR7-hL&amp;s=gFLwppFSDjU_-1lDT3VY0rq2HodCvB2ldcN2SH3d-ic&amp;e=\" style=\"width:72.75pt\" filled=\"f\" strokecolor=\"#460273\" strokeweight=\"1px\"><v:textbox style=\"mso-fit-shape-to-text:t\" inset=\"0pt,9pt,0pt,9pt\"><center style=\"font-size:14px;line-height:24px;color:#57068C;font-family:PT Sans,Trebuchet MS,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-text-raise:1.5px\">Register</center></v:textbox></v:rect><![endif]--></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n          </div>\r\n        <!--[if mso]></td></tr></table><![endif]-->\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  \r\n      <div class=\"layout one-col fixed-width stack\" style=\"Margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;min-width: 320px; width: 320px;width: calc(28000% - 167400px);overflow-wrap: break-word;word-wrap: break-word;word-break: break-word;\">\r\n        <div class=\"layout__inner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;display: table;width: 100%;background-color: #eee6f3;\">\r\n        <!--[if mso]><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" role=\"presentation\"><tr class=\"layout-fixed-width\" style=\"background-color: #eee6f3;\"><td style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"w560\"><![endif]-->\r\n          <div class=\"column\" style=\"text-align: left;color: #6b6b6b;font-size: 16px;line-height: 24px;font-family: PT Serif,Georgia,serif;\">\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div style=\"mso-line-height-rule: exactly;line-height: 20px;font-size: 1px;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div style=\"mso-line-height-rule: exactly;mso-text-raise: 11px;vertical-align: middle;\">\r\n        <h3 class=\"size-18\" style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;font-style: normal;font-weight: normal;color: #000;font-size: 17px;line-height: 26px;\" lang=\"x-size-18\"><strong>Crafting Your Cover Letter</strong></h3><p style=\"Margin-top: 12px;Margin-bottom: 0;\"><strong>Friday, December 5th, 1:00-2:00PM<br>\r\nSilver Center 120 &amp; Virtual</strong></p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 20px;\">Dreading the internship cover letter?
