The Quad Fellowship is designed to build ties among the next generation of scientists and technologists and builds on the renewed commitment to regional cooperation. We can’t wait to see what Nina accomplishes in the fellowship year!\r\n\r\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Okinawa, Nina Harano developed an interest in science through interactions with students at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) during high school, which inspired her to study abroad. After graduating from Columbia University in the United States with a departmental honor in neuroscience, she is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the GSAS-affiliated Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Her research in the Sigurdsson Lab focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly recovery from tau-mediated pathologies. Through her research, she aims to bridge science and society by serving as a bridge between Japan and the United States.\r\n\r\nAsk a Hiring Manager: What Employers Look for in Candidates\r\n\r\nTuesday, November 11th, 1:00-2:00PM\r\n\r\nVirtual\r\n\r\nAs part of our Ask the Expert Series, get an insider scoop on navigating the job market from a hiring manager who will share what employers look for in candidates.

The Quad Fellowship is designed to build ties among the next generation of scientists and technologists and builds on the renewed commitment to regional cooperation. We can&#8217;t wait to see what Nina accomplishes in the fellowship year!</p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 0;\"><em>Born in Tokyo and raised in Okinawa, Nina Harano developed an interest in science through interactions with students at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) during high school, which inspired her to study abroad. After graduating from Columbia University in the United States with a departmental honor in neuroscience, she is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at \r\nthe GSAS-affiliated Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Her research in the Sigurdsson Lab focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly recovery from tau-mediated pathologies. Through her research, she aims to bridge science and society by serving as a bridge between Japan and the United States.</em></p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n          </div>\r\n        <!--[if mso]></td></tr></table><![endif]-->\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  \r\n      <div class=\"layout one-col fixed-width stack\" style=\"Margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;min-width: 320px; width: 320px;width: calc(28000% - 167400px);overflow-wrap: break-word;word-wrap: break-word;word-break: break-word;\">\r\n        <div class=\"layout__inner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;display: table;width: 100%;background-color: #eee6f3;\">\r\n        <!--[if mso]><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" role=\"presentation\"><tr class=\"layout-fixed-width\" style=\"background-color: #eee6f3;\"><td style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"w560\"><![endif]-->\r\n          <div class=\"column\" style=\"text-align: left;color: #6b6b6b;font-size: 16px;line-height: 24px;font-family: PT Serif,Georgia,serif;\">\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div style=\"mso-line-height-rule: exactly;line-height: 10px;font-size: 1px;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n          </div>\r\n        <!--[if mso]></td></tr></table><![endif]-->\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  \r\n      <div style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">\r\n        <div class=\"layout one-col stack\" style=\"Margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;min-width: 320px; width: 320px;width: calc(28000% - 167400px);overflow-wrap: break-word;word-wrap: break-word;word-break: break-word;\">\r\n          <div class=\"layout__inner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;display: table;width: 100%;\">\r\n          <!--[if mso]><table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" role=\"presentation\"><tr class=\"layout-full-width\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"><td class=\"layout__edges\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"w560\"><![endif]-->\r\n            <div class=\"column\" style=\"text-align: left;color: #6b6b6b;font-size: 16px;line-height: 24px;font-family: PT Serif,Georgia,serif;\">\r\n            \r\n        <div style=\"font-size: 12px;font-style: normal;font-weight: normal;line-height: 19px;\" align=\"center\">\r\n          <img class=\"gnd-corner-image gnd-corner-image-center gnd-corner-image-top gnd-corner-image-bottom\" style=\"border: 0;display: block;height: auto;width: 100%;max-width: 360px;\" alt=\"Upcoming Events\" width=\"360\" src=\"https://i4.cmail20.com/ei/d/B9/1D5/26F/063759/csfinal/UpcomingEvents2-990000079e03cf3c.png\">\r\n        </div>\r\n      \r\n            </div>\r\n          <!--[if mso]></td><td class=\"layout__edges\">&nbsp;</td></tr></table><![endif]-->\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  \r\n      <div class=\"layout one-col fixed-width stack\" style=\"Margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;min-width: 320px; width: 320px;width: calc(28000% - 167400px);overflow-wrap: break-word;word-wrap: break-word;word-break: break-word;\">\r\n        <div class=\"layout__inner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;display: table;width: 100%;background-color: #eee6f3;\">\r\n        <!--[if mso]><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" role=\"presentation\"><tr class=\"layout-fixed-width\" style=\"background-color: #eee6f3;\"><td style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"w560\"><![endif]-->\r\n          <div class=\"column\" style=\"text-align: left;color: #6b6b6b;font-size: 16px;line-height: 24px;font-family: PT Serif,Georgia,serif;\">\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div style=\"mso-line-height-rule: exactly;line-height: 20px;font-size: 1px;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n        \r\n            <div style=\"Margin-left: 20px;Margin-right: 20px;\">\r\n      <div style=\"mso-line-height-rule: exactly;mso-text-raise: 11px;vertical-align: middle;\">\r\n        <h3 class=\"size-18\" style=\"Margin-top: 0;Margin-bottom: 0;font-style: normal;font-weight: normal;color: #000;font-size: 17px;line-height: 26px;\" lang=\"x-size-18\"><strong>Ask a Hiring Manager: What Employers Look for in Candidates</strong></h3><p style=\"Margin-top: 12px;Margin-bottom: 0;\"><strong>Tuesday, November 11th, 1:00-2:00PM<br>\r\nVirtual</strong></p><p style=\"Margin-top: 20px;Margin-bottom: 20px;\">As part of our Ask the Expert Series, get an insider scoop on navigating the job market from a hiring manager who will share what employers look for in candidates.
