The Quad Fellowship is designed to build ties among the next generation of scientists and technologists and builds on the renewed commitment to regional cooperation. We can\\'t wait to see what Nina accomplishes in the fellowship year! Born in Tokyo and raised in Okinawa, Nina Harano developed an interest in science through interactions with students at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) during high school, which inspired her to study abroad. After graduating from Columbia University in the United States with a departmental honor in neuroscience, she is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at \\r\\nthe GSAS-affiliated Vilcek Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences.
