There, you will find full descriptions of core curriculum as well as departmental electives approved for completion of the Advanced Certificate in the Public Humanities. Please note the website will continue to be updated when/if any additional courses become eligible.  The Case Studies in Public Humanities (PUBHM-1101) course is hands-on and experiential, rather than seminar-based, meaning that you\\'ll get the chance to actively work on real public humanities projects. It is open to all GSAS graduate students and provides an exciting opportunity to get practical experience with public-facing work. This semester, we are excited to offer a new partnership with the Kevorkian Center and a continuation of our existing \\r\\npartnership with The Hemispheric Institute: Case Studies in Public Humanities (PUBHM-1101): Public Pedagogies and Policies with the Kevorkian Center In this course, you will work with the Kevorkian Center team to foster public understanding of various world regions, including the Middle East, around issues and challenges of everyday life for people across the globe and in NYC, mainly through public K-12 education and outreach. \\r\\nCoursework likely involves three project topics - Kevo\\'s Spring Institute, transforming NYC civic education, and public humanities grant-writing. Case Studies in Public Humanities (PUBHM-1101): The Hemispheric Institute and HIDVL In this practice-based course you will take up the practice, theory, and politics of archive making through collaborative work on the Hemispheric Institute Digital Video Library (HIDVL), a groundbreaking archive of theater, performance, \\r\\nart, activism, and scholarship from across the Americas from the 1960s to the present. The seminar will meet weekly for the first 7 sessions to introduce the work, history, and archival tasks at Hemi. After those 7 sessions, your seminar attendance becomes more individualized and flexible, and your projects will guide your schedule. You will work with the Hemi team to help create new HIDVL collections, understand the meaning and making of archives and metadata, contextualize collection videos with metadata and research resources, create profiles for new collections, learn how to conduct an artist interview, create a Research Guide on a subject of your choosing in HIDVL, and conduct a User Experience survey. Spanish, Portuguese, or Kreyòl language skills are helpful but not required.
