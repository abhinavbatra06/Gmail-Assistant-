The main heuristic we used is for larger groups to present first. Due to the very large number of projects this time, in both days (Dec 3 and Dec 10) we may go well beyond the lecture time. So, if you have another commitment after the lecture of your assigned day, please email me ASAP. If I don't hear from you by the end of the day Wed the 26th, I will assume you are OK with your assigned slot. Thanks Z GPUs Go to Announcements >> You are receiving this message because you subscribed to receive instant notifications via email. Change Notification Settings",
