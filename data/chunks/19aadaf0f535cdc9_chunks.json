size tradeoffs\nHardware constraints (GPU memory) dictate the largest batch size\nShould we try to work with the largest possible batch size ?\nLarge batch size gives more confidence in gradient esKmaKon\nLarge batch size allows you to work with higher learning rates, faster convergence\nLarge batch size leads to poor generalizaSon\nLands on sharp minima wheareas small batch SGD find flat minima which generalize beTer\nSmall batches introduce stochasKc noise into gradient esKmates, which acts as implicit regularizaKon by helping the opKmizer escape sharp local minima\n65\nSingle Node,

batch size increases throughput\nBatch size is restricted by GPU memory\nTraining Sme with single GPU very large: 6 days with Places dataset (2.5M images) using Alexnet on a single K40.\nSmall batch

This method involves applying a pure Cartesian moment to a spinal segment or a functional spinal unit (FSU) in each physiologic plane, then measuring  the  resulting  range  of  motion  (ROM),  loading  and unloading stiffness, hysteresis, and neutral zone (NZ) behavior. While  planar  moment  testing  is  a  standardized  and  powerful tool,  it  leaves  the  spinal  motion-loading  space  in-  between planes  untested  and  unknown.  Adding  more  simultaneous dimensions of  loading  in  a  full-field  multi-planar  methodology will  lead  to  deeper  insight  into  the  complex  physiological behavior of the spine in various surgical interventions.\nTo  address  this  gap,  we  propose  a  novel  testing  protocol  that uses  six-degree-of-freedom  trajectories  to  produce  complex motion paths which mapping the spine's full-field  multi-planar behavior. This exploration enables multidimensional visualization  of  the spine's bending  stiffness  in  all  directions within its physiological limits. The objective of this study was to debut complex multi-planar spinal testing, explore visualization strategies,  and  identify  spinal  behavior  insights  gained  relative to traditional testing.\nPhilip Brown, PhD\nAssociate Professor, Biomedical Engineering Director, Translational Engineering and Design Core\nOffice: 336-716-0945\nphibrown@wakehealth.edu www.linkedin.com/in/philip-brown-71a24553\nCS\n2S\n1\nle\nCAPLA\nWake Forest University School of Medicine\nProject 5 - Summer 2026\nAssessment of Pedestrian Crash Protection Systems using RealWorld Pedestrian Crash Data in CARLA\nModern vehicles are equipped with advanced safety features including pedestrian crash avoidance but there are still numerous scenarios  where  these  systems  fail  to  avoid crashes.\nCARLA  is  an  open-source  tool  developed  to support the development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems.\nThe  project  objective  is  to  use  this  tool  to assess  existing  and  new  safety  systems  by reconstructing real-world pedestrian crashes.\nThe student will help create pedestrian crash scenarios and test different sensor suites in a virtual environment.\nStudent will build skills in pythonprogramming, crash data analysis, biomechanics, and injury analysis.\nKaran Devane, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Biomedical Engineering VT-WFU Center for Injury Biomechanics School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences 575 N.

Our fundamental motivation for this work is to 1. Modernize the code offered by creating a fully web-based tool and 2. Update the existing code to interact with a Crash Test  Database  that  already  exists  online.  The  approach  we  will  take  involves  a  ground  up reconstruction of the underlying code. The student will assist by helping build the code and running calculations of fundamental biomechanical measures used in kinematic, kinetic and injury assessments. The project is sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  This is an opportunity to see your work be used by hundreds or even thousands of users worldwide.\nThe  project  will  marry  the  fields  of  web-based  software  development  and  biomechanics  and represents an exciting opportunity for engineers interested in both domains. The skills and training a student  will  develop  on  for  this  project  will  be  highly  translatable  for  careers  in  biomechanics  or software development.\nThis  research effort will  be  in  the  Center  for  Injury Biomechanics (CIB) and you will have the opportunity to work on a range of projects centered around safety.

While changes in net HA abundance in biofluids can be probed conventionally, this metric ignores a critical size-function relationship in which high- and low-molecular weight (MW) HA exhibit contrasting effects on inflammation, angiogenesis, cell motility, and more. Consequently, determination  of  both  HA  abundance and size  distribution  is  essential.  However,  many  important physiological  systems  contain  small  total  amounts  of  HA  and  technologies  for  comprehensive assessment have critical limitations in sensitivity as well as challenges in dynamic range, cost, ease of implementation, and/or delivery of quantitative results.\nIn response, our laboratory has applied a  molecular detection strategy using the solid-state nanopore platform,  which  is  able  to  detect  and  size  HA  electrically and with tremendous sensitivity.

During  the  pitching  motion,  the  body  is  considered  a kinetic chain. The lower extremities generate force that is transferred through the trunk, arm, and ultimately to the hand to propel the baseball. Disruption or inefficiency within this chain increases arm stress and injury risk. It is well known that pitching velocity is related to arm stress. Therefore, the  faster  a  pitcher  throws  the  greater  their  risk  of  injury.  However,  there  are  also  pitching biomechanics and other variables that influence arm stress, pitch velocity, and ball metrics. The goal of  the  Wake  Forest  Pitching  Laboratory  is  to  find  this  balance  between  minimized  injury  risk  and maximized performance -deemed pitching efficiency.\nThe  student  will:  1)  review  literature  on pitching biomechanics 2) collect 3D motion capture data of baseball pitchers, and 3) analyze the influence of kinematics, fatigue, strength, and/or functional movement  on  arm  kinetics,  ball  velocity, and  ball  metrics. The  student  will  apply skills they learn in human subjects' research, experimental design, data collection  and  processing,  biomechanics and  human  movement, and statistical analysis to better understand pitching efficiency.\nKristen Nicholson, PhD\nAssociate Professor, Orthopedic Surgery Wake Forest Baptist Health Medical Center Boulevard Winston-Salem, NC 27157\n2S\n/e\n1\nWake Forest University\nSchool of Medicine\nProject 17 - Summer 2026\nCrash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN)\nCIREN  is  a  research  catalyst  that  can  be  used  to  conduct  a  wide  range  of  motor  vehicle trauma studies.

While  ATDs  have  been  effective  in  reducing  injury  in several domains, their use is limited in spaceflight as the dynamic events often involve the use of a seat or space suit that may not be compatible with the ATDs, and the dynamic events themselves may not be reproducible in a laboratory setting. Finite element human body models, on the other hand, can be outfitted with a space suit and fit  into  any  seat  design  that  may  be used. These  models can then predict the loads, accelerations, etc., of the body during the dynamic phases  of  flight.  However,  the  acceptable  level  of  injury risk in spaceflight is much lower than in analogous domains such as the automotive industry. There are currently no established thresholds for which loads on these human body models correspond to these lower levels of injury probability. These tasks seek to identify these thresholds, also known as injury assessment reference values (IARVs), for the neck and lumbar spine.\nschool.wakehealth.edu/faculty /d/karan-shamrao-devane\nAssistant Professor, Biomedical Engineering Karan Devane, PhD\nVT-WFU Center for Injury Biomechanics School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences 575 N.

These  images  can  be used to quantify changes in volumetric bone mineral density (BMD)  as  well  as  structural  changes  by  providing  detailed resolution of the bone microarchitecture.\nThese data are being used by our group in the clinical setting as part of interventional trials designed to evaluate the outcome of varying  weight  loss  modalities  (dietary,  exercise,  surgical)  on metrics  of  bone  health.

We  are  conducting  studies utilizing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assess muscle changes with  weight  loss  (diet/exercise-based  or  bariatric  surgery),  disease  (e.g.  myotonic  dystrophy;  heart failure),  or  normal  aging.  We  apply  automated  machine-learning  and  semi-automated  methods  to assess changes in muscle area, volume, quality, and intermuscular fat in CT and MR scans.\nWe  also  use  automated  radiomics  analysis  to extract high-dimensional muscle quality measures, such as uniformity, heterogeneity, randomness,  and  repetitive  patterns  from  CT. These  muscle  properties  can  be  correlated  to bone  mineral  density  and  bone  strength,  which we  derive  from  imaging.  These  analyses  assess effectiveness of interventions, characterize mechanisms of disease, identify therapeutic targets, and will help establish imaging biomarkers to predict musculoskeletal decline.\nThe  student  on  this  project  will  be  trained  in image segmentation and pipelines for quantifying  muscle  properties  from  radiology.

Increased survival rates along with a younger  demographic  shift  makes  patient  survivorship issues, particularly cardiovascular disease, a forefront of clinical concern in an important patient group with decades of life  to  protect.  Cardiotoxicity  concerns  limit  therapeutic  options  and  offset  expected  therapeutic benefits. Current clinical detection  paradigms are based on semi-quantitative and subjective assessments that are only able to detect late-stage irreversible cardiac decline. There is a compelling need for new methods to assess early cardiac dysfunction to allow for interventional opportunities to minimize  cancer  therapy-induced  cardiotoxicity  while  maximizing  cancer  treatment  effect.  We  have recently  shown  the  development  of  novel  myocardial  mechanical  stiffness  phenotyping  tools.  This project  seeks  to  further  develop  and  optimize  biomechanical  model-embedded  cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) assessment of myocardial mechanical elasticity to accurately and non-invasively detect cancer treatment-related changes in left ventricular stiffness as an early indicator of cardiac dysfunction to inform therapeutic management strategies for breast cancer patients prior to irreversible cardiovascular damage.\nThe student will gain experience with medical image processing (segmentation, registration) and biophysical finite element modeling based on  MRI  data.

Our  group  is  again  part  of  a  team  of  investigators  examining  spaceflight  affects  on musculoskeletal health. Our team is examining if artificial gravity and/or spaceflight-relevant radiation exposure can protects against spaceflight environment-induced damage to bone and joint tissues.\nThis spaceflight mission for our REU team member involved sending mice to the International Space Station  in  March,  2023,  and  also  that  were  exposed  to  spaceflight  radiation  at  the  NASA  Space Radiation Lab. For the spaceflight study, we exposed the mice to continuous artificial gravity as via centrifugation aboard the ISS, as part of a joint study between NASA and the Japanese Space Agency. Mice received different gravitational levels, including near 0G, 0.67G, 0.33G (Martian), and 1G, to see if  artificial  gravity  could  project  against  skeletal  damage.  Likewise,  rodents  were  exposed  to spaceflight radiation and / or simulated microgravity.\nThe  REU  student  will have  the opportunity to perform skeletal-related analyses across tissues.

However,  the  complexity  of  modern  PPE  and  the  variety  of  design  criteria,  certification requirements, and performance considerations require a labor intensive and experimentally demanding design process. Adding to these difficulties are the lack of suitable and accessible human surrogates for translating the effectiveness of PPE in testing to prediction of real-world performance for military personnel in theater. Advanced digital engineering tools are poised to fill gaps in the current PPE design process and facilitate both expedited and more comprehensive design analyses. One key tool available in the digital design space to serve this purpose is the computational Finite Element (FE) Human Body Model (HBM). Another key tool is probabilistic methodologies to facilitate  uncertainty quantification and optimization. The objective of this project is to develop a digital design tool  capable  of  rapid  design  exploration  of  PPE  through  the  coupling  of  state-of-the-art  HBMs  with  advanced probabilistic and optimization techniques.

However, such images are associated with high cost  and  low  accessibility  limiting their  utility  in  cardiovascular  diseases screening purposes. On the other hand, electrocardiogram is significantly more frequently  recorded  and  widely  accessible,  yet,  it  is  not  satisfactory  for  gold standard  diagnosis  of  most  diseases.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  for  artificial intelligence  tools  to  convert  information  in  ECG  signals  into  rich  information gathered from these cardiac imaging modalities.\nThis research effort will be in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and the Center for Artificial Intelligence.

Chest  X-rays  are  one  of  the  most  common  diagnostic  imaging  tests, capable of revealing a wide range of conditions including cancer, pneumonia, and collapsed lungs. However, the interpretation of these images can be challenging and subject to human error,  with  missed  lung  nodules  being  a  predominant  cause  of  malpractice  claims  in  chest imaging.\nDeep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical image analysis, with the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses. This project aims to develop a robust and interpretable  deep  learning  framework  to  automatically  detect and classify various anomalies in chest X-ray images. By automating  this  detection  process,  we  can  create  a  low-cost, scalable  tool  to  assist  radiologists,  prioritize  urgent  cases,  and ultimately improve patient care.\nLearning Objectives:\nGain hands-on experience with deep learning for medical image analysis.\nLearn and apply computer vision techniques on lung pathologies.\nWork with large-scale, real-world chest X-ray datasets and address challenges such as class imbalance and data variability.\nDevelop skills in model validation and interpretation in a clinical context.\nExpectation\n: Good programming skills in python, familiarity with\nPyTorch and basic knowledge of Machine learning/Deep learning.\nMetin Gurcan, Ph.D.\nSenior Associate Dean for Artificial Intelligence\nDirector, Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Pathology, BME Wake Forest University School of Medicine https://school.wakehealth.edu/research/labs/clinical-image-analysis-lab\ne\nE\ne\nb\nWake Forest University\nSchool of Medicine\nProject 31 - Summer 2026\nOtoscopy Assistant Diagnosis System with Integrated Classification and Out-of-Distribution Detection\nEar diseases are highly prevalent worldwide and often require expert evaluation of otoscopic images  and  videos  for  accurate  diagnosis.  However,  variations  in  image  quality,  patient anatomy,  and  disease  presentation  make  automated  analysis  challenging.  This  project focuses on developing an advanced assistant diagnostic system for otoscopy by combining disease classification with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.\nThe classification component aims to train state-of-the-art deep learning models to accurately identify common otologic conditions such as effusion, perforation, and infection. Simultaneously, the OOD detection module will identify samples that fall outside the distribution of the training dataset, such as images of rare diseases, poor-quality frames, or ambiguous cases that  are  difficult even  for  clinicians  to  diagnose.  This  dual approach ensures that the system can not only provide reliable predictions for known conditions but also flag uncertain or novel cases  for  further  expert  review,  thereby  increasing  safety  and trustworthiness in clinical applications.\nLearning Objectives:\nGain hands-on experience with deep learning for medical image\nNormal\nPerforation\nand video analysis.

These differences can make it difficult to quickly capture  key  information  when  a  patient  is  transferred  to  another  department  or  hospital. This  project  aims  to  create  a  more  systematic,  standardized  structure  for  patient  notes  to ensure critical information is easier to find and interpret across different settings.\nSignificance\nInconsistent  documentation  formats  across  hospitals and  regions  can  lead  to  missed  critical  information, delayed care, and unnecessary repetition of tests. By standardizing the structure of discharge and anamnesis notes, this project will improve continuity of  care,  prevent  oversight  of  life-saving  details,  and make patient follow-up more systematic and efficient.\nLearning Objectives:\nTo  develop  and  validate  a  Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  model  capable  of  accurately identifying and extracting key clinical entities from unstructured, free-text discharge notes. These entities include diagnoses, medications, procedures, allergies, lab results, and followup plans To evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-generated standardized notes by measuring reductions in documentation time for physicians and improvements in information retrieval accuracy by receiving clinicians.

While  genomic  assays  like  Oncotype  DX  provide  recurrence  risk scores,  they  are  expensive  and  not  universally  available.  Histopathological  examination  of H&E-stained tissue slides remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, and these images contain a wealth of morphological information that correlates with tumor aggression and, ultimately, recurrence risk.\nHowever, a pathologist's visual assessment of recurrence risk is inherently subjective and based on integrating a complex set of features like tumor grade, mitotic activity, and the nature of the tumor-immune interface. This project aims to develop a robust and interpretable deep learning framework to objectively predict breast  cancer  recurrence  directly  from  standard  H&E-stained Whole  Slide  Images  (WSIs).  By  automating  this  prediction,  we can create a low-cost, scalable tool to augment clinical decisionmaking and better stratify patients.\nLearning Objectives:\nGain hands-on experience with deep learning for medical image analysis.

This project focuses on developing a model that can automatically detect whether a slide contains pathological findings, even spotting abnormalities that the human eye might miss. In places where pathologists are not available, diagnosis can be delayed, which affects treatment decisions and patient outcomes. This project aims to support healthcare teams by providing a reliable, AI-powered screening tool that speeds up the process and helps ensure no critical findings are overlooked.\nOur Approach:\nWe will use a dataset of H&E-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and apply deep learning based segmentation algorithms to identify nuclei and tissue regions. These segmented regions will then be analyzed with classification models to determine whether the slide shows any pathological features.\nLearning Objectives: Key learning objectives include implementing\nsegmentation models to identify nuclei and tissue regions and developing classification models to detect pathological features. The primary expectation is to build, train, and quantitatively evaluate a complete AI pipeline for automated slide analysis, culminating in a functional and well-documented system.\nExpectation: The participant is expected to gain hands-on experience in digital pathology by applying deep learning algorithms to H&E-stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs).\nMetin Gurcan, Ph.D.\nSenior Associate Dean for Artificial Intelligence Director, Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Pathology, BME Wake Forest University School of Medicine https://school.wakehealth.edu/research/labs/clinical-image-analysis-lab\nlea uL models by spatial perspecuives of the Input adla (clu).\nr\neS.\nDL\n12 Lead ECG\nWake Forest University 64.3.2 64,3,2 16.3,1 32311 32,1,2 64,1,2\nSchool of Medicine\nInput\nConviD\nBatch\nNormalization\nLeaky RELU\nAdd\nMax Pooling\nDropout\nFlatten\nProject 35 - Summer 2026\nNovel Deep learning Algorithms and Explainable AI on ECG\nBackground : In Deep Learning (DL), there are various types of layers that are specialized for specific tasks.

However, there is still a gap in the literature to design a DL layer for ECG specific. And the black-box side of the DL is still an open-research area, specifically for ECG based models.\nGoal : The goal of this project is to build ECG inputted novel DL algorithms (layers, activation functions, or architecture based) for prediction/classification of cardiovascular diseases.

Traditional methods using polygenic risk scores only explore the risk of a single disease for every single gene, omitting the high-level genetic interaction of genomic sequences that are associated with multiple diseases. The recent development of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model has shown success in the comprehension of high-level context in sequence data such as sentences. Similarly, NLP models can also be applied to genomic sequences to extract high-level genotype information for multiple related diseases. However, studies in this field is still limited despite the strong potential.\nGoal : The goal of this project is to 1) develop novel NLP-based deep learning models on genomic data to predict the composite risk for multiple diseases.\nExpectation : The student in this project will be expected to have Python programming skills and work on 1) developing representation learning models to extract high-level genomic features 2) predicting multi-disease risk factors and identifying high-level genomic associations.\nDa Ma, PhD\nAssociate Professor,\nGerontology and Geriatric Medicine Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR)\nMichael Horvath, MS\nLead Programmer / Analyst, Clinical and Translational Science Institute\nAlzheimer's Disease Research Center\nWake Forest University School of Medicine https://school.wakehealth.edu/faculty/m/da-ma\nWake Forest University School of Medicine\nProject 37 - Summer 2026\nMultimodal System for Early Identification of Cardiovascular Diseases\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Many forms of CVDs are progressive and develop over time. Early identification and guided treatment may assist to manage the disease and reduce the burden. In this project, we will collect data from patients and analyze data to identify early signs of CVDs. We will develop a multimodal system to record different signals  such  as  temperature,  blood  pressure  and  ECGs  from  patients  and healthy subjects. We will analyze data to find abnormalities associated with CVDs.\nThe  student  will:  1)  review  literature  on vital signs analysis, 2) develop a multimodal  system,  3)  collect  data  from patients and healthy subject, and 4) analyze data to find abnormalities.\nBackground in electronic circuits, statistical analysis and hands-onexperience with electronic equipment will be essential for this project.\nMohammad Moghimi, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Center for Remote Health Monitoring Wake Forest University School of Medicine\n575 Patterson Ave, Suite 120 Winston-Salem, NC 27101\nmanagement Increase the chance or successtul treatment ana reauce the burden.\nWake Forest University In this project, we will develop a wearable patch that can be used by individuals out of clinical setting to evaluate the risk of melanoma on decolored parts of skin\nSchool of Medicine\nMedical Tape\nProject 38 - Summer 2026\nWearable Flexible Patch for Early Identification of Melanoma\nMelanoma is the most malicious type of skin cancer, and the incidence was on rise in  the  last  decades.  In  the  United  States  alone,  97,610  new  cases  of  melanoma were  diagnosed  in  2023,  and  mortality  rate  was  7,9901.  Melanoma  may  leave marks  on  skin  and  cause  cosmetic  issues  for  the  patients.  As  the  tumor  grows, melanoma  may  metastasize  and  result  in  death.  Early  identification  and  timely management increase the chance of successful treatment and reduce the burden. In this project, we will develop a wearable patch that can be used by individuals out of clinical setting to evaluate the risk of melanoma on decolored parts of skin and lesions.\nThe  student  will:  1)  review  literature  on melanoma detection, 2) optimize the flexible patch, 3) collect data from lesions, and  4)  analyze  data  from  benign  and malignant tumors.\nBackground in electronic circuits, statistical analysis and hands-onexperience with electronic equipment will be essential for this project.\nWearable patch placed on a lesions\n2 cm\nPatch\nMedical Tape\nPatient\nMohammad Moghimi, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Center for Remote Health Monitoring Wake Forest University School of Medicine\n575 Patterson Ave, Suite 120 Winston-Salem, NC 27101\nPatch and lesions.\nWake Forest University\nSchool of Medicine\nProject 39 - Summer 2026\nAI-Assisted Pre-screening for Neurological Disorders\nNeurological  disorders  (NDs)  are  the  number  one  cause  of  disability  and  the second leading cause of death globally. Evidence is emerging showing that NDs are in fact multi system syndromes affecting different aspects of patients' health and  well-being. Early diagnosis enables  access to timely intervention  and therapeutics. However, diagnosis of most NDs is challenging due to heterogeneity of disease and lack of evident physical phenotypes. The goal of this project is to use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist the diagnostic process and characterize the clinical risk associated with NDs.\nThe  student  will:  1)  review  literature  on prevalence and diagnosis of different neurological  disorders,  2)  evaluate  the previously trained model on a new dataset,  3)  evaluate  the  model  across various patient subgroups defined by race/ethnicity,  sex,  and  co-occurrence  of key  diagnosis.

This project is developing rate of aging (RoA) metrics using machine learning and AI-based tools across a range of non-human primate (NHP) species based on routinely collected clinical data. We will use these RoA to identify shared and species-specific patterns of biological aging across 15,000 NHPs to test if longer lifespans within and between species are associated with increased physiological disruption later in life and a slower pace of biological aging. We will then identify genetic variants that differentiate exceptionally fast and slow agers to characterize pathways mediating health and lifespan differences within and between species. This will leverage existing sequence data in >3,000 NHPs to identify  rare  and  common  genetic  variants  associated  with  lifespan,  healthspan,  and  pace  of  aging within species. This data will be used to identify the underlying biology driving differences in longevity within  and  between  species  which  will  highlight  biological  pathways  for  potential  interventions  in human patients.\nThe student will  gain  experience  in  training and  fine-tuning  neural  network  algorithms, handling large-scale datasets, and performing genetic and bioinformatics analyses. They will also learn how to perform  phylogenetic  analyses  across  nonhuman  primate  species to interpret the evolution  of  longevity  in  humans  and  the translational potential of non-human primate data.\nEllen Quillen, PhD\nAssociate Professor Department of Internal Medicine-Molecular Medicine Center for Precision Medicine Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Wake Forest University School of Medicine http://www.quillenlab.org/\nC\nWake Forest University\nSchool of Medicine\nProject 41 - Summer 2026\nMulti-Modal Fusion of Histopathology and Omics Data for Precision Cancer Diagnosis\nThe goal of this project is to enhance cancer diagnosis by integrating histopathology images and multiomics molecular data, which are publicly available from datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  This  project  will  guide  students  through  the  process  of  analyzing  these  large  and  diverse datasets. Initially, the project will address the processing of gigapixel-sized whole slide images (WSIs), which are essential for assessing the morphological characteristics of cancerous tissues. Due to their enormity and complexity, WSIs  cannot be  analyzed  in  their  entirety  efficiently.  Instead,  they  will  be broken down into smaller, manageable sections known as patches. Each patch will be encoded as a vector,  creating  a  matrix  where  each  column  represents  the  embedding  for  a  patch,  and  the  entire matrix  encapsulates  the  comprehensive  information  of  the  WSI.  To  manage  and  interpret  this  vast amount  of  data  effectively,  linear  algebra  tools  such  as  various  matrix  decompositions  will  be employed to reduce the dimensionality of these matrices. Alongside the imaging data, molecular data from multi-omics sources provides deep insights into the genetic and molecular bases of cancer. This data  includes  detailed  genomic,  transcriptomic,  and  proteomic  information  that,  when  analyzed  in conjunction with WSIs, can reveal comprehensive insights into the biological behavior of tumors. The project  will  explore  how  the  integration  of  these  two  distinct  data  modalities  can  significantly transform patient diagnosis and treatment planning by providing a more nuanced understanding of the disease.\nLearning Objectives: Through this project, students will not only develop technical skills in handling and analyzing large-scale datasets using Python and its associated libraries but also deepen  their  understanding  of  the  statistical challenges in data integration. The knowledge of linear algebra will be applied to real-world scenarios,  enhancing  the students' ability to manage and interpret complex datasets.\nPrerequisites: Students interested in participating in this project should have a basic understanding of statistics and linear algebra.

Traditional manual coding methods for quantifying maternal behaviors  are timeintensive and subjective. The goal of this project is to develop an automated computer vision pipeline to analyze video recordings of vervet monkey mothers with their infants, quantifying maternal care behaviors and  correlating  these  patterns  with  microbiome  transmission  data.  This  will  provide  insights  into  how specific maternal behaviors influence the establishment of the gut microbiome in early life.\nThe  student  will  gain  hands-on  experience  with  computer  vision  techniques  including  object  detection, tracking algorithms, and pose estimation.

Moreover,  whether  microstructural  differences  in  the  retina  or  optic  nerve  may explain relationships  between visual  and physical  function  is  not  known.
