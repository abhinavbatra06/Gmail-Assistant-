I'll provide them with a list of questions, depending on which type of interview they want to practice. I'll also float from group to group and provide my own feedback. I've interviewed over 100+ candidates for various technical roles, and have some insight into what works and what doesn't. If you think this would be helpful to the students in your program, please pass it along. Thanks and have a good thanksgiving! Nico https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-cernek-39834837/",
