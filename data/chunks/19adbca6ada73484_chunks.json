One member can present, or all members, or you can record a presentation and play it during the presentation days. As per the project slides each presentation is 8 mins followed by two minutes of Q&A between myself and the group. So, all group members must be present, even if you decide to play a pre-recorded presentations. We will be very strict with the timing and apply a penalty for each extra minute you take and also a penalty for not sticking to the slides format. The format is specified in the  slides discussing projects. For those who decide to play a pre-recorded presentation, please learn how to share your laptop voice through zoom. In previous years, some groups did not know how to do it. You may want to make a test among yourselves before the presentation day to avoid any delay. All the best!
