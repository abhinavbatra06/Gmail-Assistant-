Thank you, Ankita ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Ankita Tripathi < at6651@nyu.edu > Date: Wed, Nov 19, 2025 at 11:54 PM Subject: GPUs Final Presentation To: Mohamed Zahran < mohamed.zahran@nyu.edu > Hi Professor Zahran, I hope you're well. I wanted to discuss a potential time conflict for the GPU project's presentation. I have a final presentation for another class on December 10th at 8:30 pm. Would it be possible to schedule me for the presentation on December 3rd or in an early slot on December 10th? My group number is 31 (GPU-Accelerated Monte Carlo Option Pricing: Barrier Options). Please let me know. Thank you, Ankita -- ------------------------------------------------------------- Prof. Mohamed Zahran Computer Science Department Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences NYU http://www.mzahran.com -------------------------------------------------------------",
