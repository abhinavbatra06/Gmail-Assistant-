For smaller companies: The technical screens will likely be more practical. Questions will be more relevant to the technologies and what you'll be using on the job and what they need to hire for. For large companies: The technical screens will likely be more theoretical. Think data structures and algorithms. Know your graphs and binary search trees and Big-O complexities!

A good cover letter follows a simple formula that you can apply to every single job you apply for: Who - Who you are. Easy enough. Where - Where you're coming from. Why - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them. What - What you can bring to the table. When - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you. How - How they can reach you. Check out the Career Advising page on the CDS Student Portal for more helpful resources.\r\n\r\n### NYU NEWS & RESOURCES:\r\n\r\n### Climate Week at NYU 2025\r\n\r\nSeptember is a flurry of climate action at NYU!\r\n\r\nCheck out our\r\nEvents Calendar (https://t.e2ma.net/click/1n8crh/dt03qtsf/1vakcz)\r\nand explore all the events happening across NYU for Climate Week.

It shows that you've moved from foundational knowledge to advanced skills, can think creatively, and that you're proud of your work. Portfolios are living documents, websites, or blogs that should be tended to as you complete projects. As you continue to curate your portfolio and present your hard work, your milestones and achievements will start to take on a streamlined narrative. Utilizing a digital portfolio allows you to mention it to anyone you meet, because you never know when you may meet a potential employer, colleague, or mentor. Check out the Career Advising page on the CDS Student Portal for more helpful resources.\r\n\r\n### NYU NEWS & RESOURCES:\r\n\r\n@NYU CAS\r\n\r\n  *\r\nDean (https://t.e2ma.net/click/lr4nqh/dt03qtsf/txajaz)\r\n| Fall 2025 Deadline: October 29\r\n\r\n    * Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund Grant applications are open for the Fall 2025 semester!

Don't make them have to search long and hard for you online if they want to know more! Include the tech that you used, impacts you made, and relevant things that you would bring to the table. Recruiters should be able to skim your resume and understand what role you want and what your experience level is.
